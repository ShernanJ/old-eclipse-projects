			My name is <strong>Shernan Javier</strong>, I'm a <strong>19-year-old</strong> nerd that loves to code! I enjoy learning new languages/technologies
			on my own time. I mainly develop web applications with <strong>JavaScript</strong>, My go-to Front-End JavaScript Framework is <strong>ReactJS</strong>
		 	and my Back-End would be using <strong>NodeJS</strong> which is a JavaScript Runtime Environment. These technologies are used in the <strong>MERN</strong> 
		 	Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) which I spent this summer learning.
		</p>
		<p class="about-text">
			I did a little bit of mobile application development using <strong>React Native</strong> and <strong>Flutter</strong> which are cross-platform frameworks for JavaScript and <strong>Dart</strong>.
			I also learned <strong>Java</strong> in high school but dove deeper into it at Sheridan. I know a little bit of <strong>Python</strong> but it's been a few years since I've touched it
			so I need to go back and re-learn it again. Before moving on from talking about programming, I just wanted to write about how I'm looking forward 
			to your classes as I'm excited to learn more about the Spring Framework! 
		</p>
		<p class="about-text">
			I promise I'm not a robot, I have a personality other than just coding! Here are some quick random facts about me! 
			I grew up in the <strong>Philippines</strong> up until I was 5 and moved to Canada in January 2006. I like to cook food, as well as eat a ton of it.
			I like to play video games (not so much anymore) which were mainly first-person shooters, strategy or sandbox games. I love dogs, I own one and I have another spiritually by my side watching over me!
			I don't really know what else to write but hopefully you enjoyed reading about me! <strong>If you haven't read it since this is pretty long, I wrote a "TLDR" (Too Long, Didn't Read) text at the bottom :D</strong>
